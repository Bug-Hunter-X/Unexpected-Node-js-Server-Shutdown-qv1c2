# Unexpected Node.js Server Shutdown

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js HTTP server unexpectedly shuts down, potentially leading to incomplete responses or data loss.  The cause of the shutdown isn't immediately obvious in the code, making it a difficult-to-debug issue. The solution focuses on robust error handling and preventing premature server termination.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` demonstrates a server that *may* unexpectedly shut down. This could be due to various reasons such as unhandled exceptions, resource exhaustion, or interaction with external processes.  Debugging this requires careful examination of server logs and potentially using debugging tools.
